		 <h1>About Us</h1>
			 <p>Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. The unexpected is our normal routine. The Enterprise computer
			system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad
			interface modules. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. About four years. I got tired
			of hearing how young I looked. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I guess it's better to be lucky than good.</p>
			<p>Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Could someone survive
			inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Well,
			that's certainly good to know. Computer, belay that order. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history
			of Starfleet. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. </p>
			<p>Take the ship into the Neutral
			Zone Not if I weaken first. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Maybe if we felt
			any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. And blowing into maximum
			warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data.</p>
			<p>	I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it
			at you instead of them. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Some days you get the bear, and some days the
			bear gets you. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Well, I'll say this
			for him - he's sure of himself. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. </p>
			<p>Flair is what marks the
			difference between artistry and mere competence. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Earl Grey tea,
			watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canap√©s? Are you up for promotion? A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties.
			I would *never* do that to you. Computer, lights up! Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh.</p>
